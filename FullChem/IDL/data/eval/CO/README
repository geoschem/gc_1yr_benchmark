Atmospheric CARBON MONOXIDE Mixing Ratios from Flask Samples.

The data files "data/co/flask/complete/xxx.co" (where xxx is the 3-letter 
site code; see "pub/co/flask/README" for a table of sampling sites and their 
codes), contain carbon monoxide mixing ratios along with pertinent sampling and 
analysis information tabulated by sampling site.  For each site, the data are 
ordered chronologically by sample date.  The Pacific transect shipboard data have  
file names ./xxxhll.co where xxx represents the ship, h represents the hemisphere 
(n=northern and s=southern), and ll the latiude.  The "paw" and "opc" shipboard
data have been combined into a single data set for each 5 degree latitude, under
the site code "poc".

The data files contain one line for each flask sample. 
The format for each line is:

     sta yyyy mm dd hh mm xxxxx-xx c ddddd.dd fff ii YYYY MM DD kkkkkk nt

where:

     sta =	the three-letter station code (see table in "co/flask/README").
     yyyy mm dd = the GMT year, month, and day (four digit year,
                  two digit month and day) when the sample was collected
     hh mm =	the GMT time (hour, minutes; two digits
            	each) of sample collection
     xxxxx-xx = the flask sample I.D. number.  This
                field can contain up to eight       
                characters but may contain fewer.   
                This field may contain letters as well 
                as numbers.

     c =	a one letter code that identifies the sample
        	collection method.  The codes used are:

               P     Sample collected using a       
                     portable, battery powered      
                     pumping unit.  Two flasks      
                     were connected in series,       
                     flushed with air, and then     
                     pressurized to 1.2 - 1.5       
                     times ambient pressure.

	       D     Portable pump similar to P
		     but this model contains
		     a thermo-electric drier to
		     remove water vapor from the 
		     sample.

               T     Evacuated flask filled by      
                     opening an O-ring sealed       
                     stopcock.

               S     Flask filled at NOAA/CMDL     
                     observatories by sampling air  
                     from the in situ CO2           
                     measurement air intake         
                     system.

               N     Flask were filled using a 
	             pump different from those 
		     used in methods P and D.

     NOTE:  The sample location, date-time, flask ID number and collection method
	    uniquely identify each sample.  Details of the measurement strategy 
            are given in Lang et al., 1990 a,b.


     ddddd.dd =	CO mixing ratio in ppb by mole fraction referenced to the NOAA/CMDL
                carbon monoxide scale.  Missing values are denoted by -999.99.

     fff =	a three-character flag indicating the results
          	of our data selection process.  

	  	An alphanumeric other than a period (.) in the FIRST
	  	column indicates samples with problems during 
	  	sample collection or analysis.

	  	An alphanumeric other than a period (.) in the SECOND 
	  	column indicates samples thought to represent non- 
	  	background conditions.

	  	An alphanumeric other than a period (.) in the THIRD
	  	column is a sample qualifier that is not presently used.

    		ii = a 2 character code that identifies the    
         	instrument used for the CO measurement.

		(See Novelli et al., 1992 for detailed explanation of these flags.)

     YYYY MM DD = the year (YYYY), month (MM), and day (DD),
                in local time, of the CO measurement.
 
     kkkkkk = a six character field identifying the raw file 
              for this analysis date. NO RAW indicates raw data 
              is not available.

     nt = two digit code where "n" is the nth aliquot of the total 
	  number of aliquots, "t", measured for each flask in a raw 
	  file.  Blank spaces indicate the data are not available.
