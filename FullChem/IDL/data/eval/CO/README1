Comments regarding the README and the data files are encouraged.  Send

To avoid misinterpretation of the measurements, users should read and   
understand all "README" files before using these data.  NOAA/CMDL has 
attempted to provide the most precise measurements possible.  We reserve 
the right to modify these data files if warranted by calibration issues or
data selection routines.    


*********************************RETRIEVAL*********************************

In addition to the text files found in each of the directories, there are 2
compressed tar files which contain all the files in the corresponding directories,
for example: complete.tar.Z contains all the files in the directory 'complete'.
If you want to transfer all the files in a directory, it is much more efficient
to take the tar file.  To transfer these files take the following steps from
the ftp prompt.

ftp> binary					! set transfer mode to binary

ftp> get complete.tar.Z				! transfer the file

ftp> bye					! exit ftp

$ uncompress complete.tar.Z			! uncompress your local copy

$ tar xvf complete.tar				! unpack the file

This will create a directory called 'complete' and place each of the
files in this directory.  Repeat the steps for additional tar files.

SOURCE AND SCOPE OF THE DATA: CARBON MONOXIDE


Individual site files provide CO mixing ratios in parts per billion (ppb) (ppb = 
(parts in 10*9 by mole fraction = nmole/mole) based on measurements from the NOAA/ 
CMDL Cooperative Air Sampling Network.  In this directory, data are provided through 
December 1995 for stations from which the first sample was collected before January 
1993.

The table below provides a list of all network locations from which samples for    
CO were collected from 6/88 through 7/98.  This table includes the three letter
code used to identify each site, the location of the site, latitude and long- 
itude (in degrees and minutes), the altitude of the sampling location (in meters 
above mean sea level), the start (and end dates) for sampling CO, the country, and  
the cooperating agency. Shipboard sampling occured every 5 degrees of latitude 
for two cruise tracks: the Wellington Star (PAW), and California Star (OPC)
between North America and Australia or New Zealand, and every 3 degrees 
latitude between Hong Kong and Singapore for Carla A. Hills and Great Promise
(SCS) (data not yet available). Sampling frequencies were approximately weekly for
the fixed sites, and averaged one sample every 3 weeks per latitude zone for PAW  
and OPC, and about one sample every week per latitude for SCS.  Air samples were 
collected using two general methods: 1) flushing and then pressurizing glass flasks 
with a pump.  During sampling a pair of flasks was filled in series. 2) by opening
a stopcock on an evacuated glass flask. (See Lang et al., 1990 a,b for details 
of the sampling network, the equipment and procedures)  Data from sites not
provided in this directory may be available from P. Novelli.

All samples were analyzed for CO at the NOAA/CMDL laboratory in Boulder using 
gas chromatography with mercuric oxide reduction detection, and all measure- 
ments are referenced to the CMDL CO scale (Novelli et al., 1991, Novelli et al.,
1994).

Through most of the period 1988-1991, one flask of a sample pair was 
analyzed for CO, and when there was suitable pressure remaining in the flask,
two or more aliquots were analyzed.  We have used the difference in CO
mixing ratios between the two aliquots as an indication of the precision of 
the measurement.  Details of the analytical procedures through 1990 are described
in Novelli et al., 1992. From the beginning of CO measurements in flask samples    
(mid 1987) to December 1990 we used a single point calibration sequence, as the
response characteristics of the CO instrument had been shown to be linear over a  
range of 0 to 1000 ppb CO (Novelli et al., 1991).

In January 1991, we changed instruments used for the analysis of CO in
flask air samples.  The new instrument exhibited a non-linear response over 
the range of 0 to 250 ppb CO.  Therefore it was necessary to change from a single-
point calibration routine to a multiple standard calibration scheme (a multi-
point calibration procedure based upon that used for calibration of standards,
as described in Novelli et al., 1994, was also used for flask analysis).
 
In October 1991 we began analyzing a single aliquot from both members of a flask 
pair (rather than 2 or more aliqouts from a single flask).  The principle reasons    
for the change were to simplify flask handling procedures (the CMDL carbon dioxide    
and methane projects also measure both flasks of the sample pair) and to have flask
pair agreement (the difference in mixing ratio between the two flasks collected 
simultaneously) as an additional diagnostic to use in evaluating the quality of
the data.
