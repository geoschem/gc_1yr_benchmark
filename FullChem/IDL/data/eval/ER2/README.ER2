this data!!!!!

The file, ER2wO3CO.dat.gz, contains O3 and CO data
taken from the ER2 aircraft.  The data was taken in
the Pacific in the upper troposphere and lower
stratosphere.

I've included some email exchanges with info about
file format below.

I've also include an IDL program I used to read in
the data, er2.pro.

Bryan -

I'm putting a file called "bryanout" in the same anonymous ftp 
site as before. I put the co in the same file, figured that'd be 
easier for you than merging two datasets. Columns are 
date,time,lat,lon,p,t,theta,o3,co
and format is
(I7,F9.2,F9.3,F9.3,F9.3,F9.3,F9.3,F6.0,F9.3)
but the numbers should all be at least space-delimited.
Again, '9999' is the code for missing data.

Same caveat with this data as before - this is for internal use; 
don't use for publication w/o contacting me (mine might not be 
the most recent updated version), & the actual teams that 
produced the data.

Bryan -

File of ER-2 data you asked for is on our anonymous ftp site 
(ftp.arp.harvard.edu and go to pub/moyer, look for Bryan.dat). 
It holds date, utime (greenwich mean), lat, lon, p (mb), CO 
(ppb). Watch out for {} at beginning and end of each line. We 
also have O3, altitude, theta, etc. if you want those. These are 
all ER-2 observations, all flights from 1995-1997. Missing data 
are given value of 9999.

I haven't made sure this is the latest version of the data so of 
course don't present this or use for anything but internal review 
w/o contacting me.
