This directory contains file required to process CO data for use in
the GEOS-Chem benchmark. The process was backed out from the existing
data files, so may not be exactly the same as done previously.

The file sitelist.txt contains all sites in the earlier data file.
To process all of these, first get the data (see below), then edit
batch_process_gmd.pro to specify the correct year, then run
batch_process_gmd.pro using IDL. This routine expects the following 
directory for outputing data files:
../YYYYdata/
(where YYYY is the year of data being processed).

Data are from the NOAA GMD network (previously CMDL). The data files
can be downloaded using:

wget ftp://aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/data/trace_gases/co/flask/surface/co_###_surface-flask_1_ccgg_event.txt

where ### should be replaced with the 3-letter code (all lower case)
for the site (e.g. alt for Alert, etc.). The relevant 3-letter codes
can be found in the sitelist.txt file, or you can use a wget accept
list (-A) to just get all the files.
