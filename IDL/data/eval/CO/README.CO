   All xxx.mn files have 12 lines and 7 columns. Every line corresponds to
one months, starting from January. Seven numbers in each line are: 
1. MEAN CO
2. STANDARD ERROR 
3. NUMBER OF YEARS WITH DATA,
4. MIN. MONTHLY VALUE
5. MAX. MONTHLY VALUE
6. MEDIAN MONTHLY VALUE  
7. MEAN OF MONTHLY VALUES 

   These number are calculated from original data without any data flagged 
in the first column.
   Some individual data points were excluded from analysis. There supposed 
to be 2 measurements made simultaneously every time. So if there was only
one measurement for a given time which passed original criteria (not
flagged in the first column) and it was flagged in the second column
that particular data point was not included.
   For some stations a few selected dates were excluded from consideration
based on the value being too different from other values for this months.
These stations (ship missions) and dates are:

Easter Island (eic)         - 2/15/96
Christmas Island (chr)      - 7/22/96
Pacific Ocean 10N (pocn10)  - July 1995
Pacific Ocean 5S (pocs05)   - July 1995
Pacific Ocean 25S (pocs25)  - November 1996 
Pacific Ocean 35S (pocs35)  - November 1996 

   After data selection was finished, data for individual days were
calculated ( by averaging of 2 values, if we had more than one value ) 
and monthly means for every year were formed. These annual monthly means
were used to obtain columns 1-7.

   Example - key.mn:

180.36 76.18 5 117.65 310.03 153.18 136.57
174.11 24.66 5 150.3 211.08 176.18 150.29
167.31 41.36 5 137.28 235.94 147.68 150.07
143.38 32.54 4 126.41 192.18 127.47 129.32
113.01 49.96 5 82.15 201.88 92.52 93.05
74.08 3.82 3 71.72 78.49 72.03 74.08

296.23 249.66 6 93 717.45 182.83 111.75

   File har.mn ( Harvard forest ) was not made by me. It has older data 
and only 3 meaningful columns.

There are 2 subdirectories in this directory, 92_97 and 2001 with the
means for 92-97 and 2001 correspondently. The formats of the files are
the same as in this directory.
